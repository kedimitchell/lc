# Live Coding Reflections from Reading

## New Insights / Surprising Aspects

1. **Live coding as a performative act**  
   While I was aware that live coding involves real-time programming, I hadn’t considered the extent to which it is a *performance* rather than just a tool for generating music or visuals. The idea that debugging and mistakes become part of the artistic process was unexpected and shifts the traditional perception of programming as a background task and i AM really excited and scared at the same time to work in this environment because i need to allow myslef be vulnerable to some extent during these performances.

2. **Historical and philosophical roots**  
   I was surprised to learn about live coding’s deep connections to hacker culture, experimental music, and algorithmic composition. The fact that it ties back to ideas from avant-garde composers like Iannis Xenakis and John Cage adds a historical depth I hadn’t previously associated with the practice.

## Familiar / Unsurprising Aspects

1. **Use of open-source tools**  
   It was not surprising that live coding communities emphasize open-source software and accessibility. Many creative coding scenes rely on open-source environments to foster collaboration and innovation.

2. **Improvisation as a core element**  
   Given that live coding is often used in electronic music performances, I expected improvisation to be central to the process. It makes sense that live coders constantly tweak their code in real time to respond to the dynamics of a performance.
