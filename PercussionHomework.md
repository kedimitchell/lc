/// Documentation:  I used stack() to combine multiple rhythmic patterns. 
///I created a groove with a blend of bass drum (bd), snare (sn), rimshot (rim), hi-hat (hh), clap (cp), and open hi-hat (ho). 
///I randomly added ! and ? symbols to create probability-based variations, making the rhythm more dynamic and less repetitive.
